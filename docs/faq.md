    # Why not travis CI?
    Travis CI is a great service, however, github actions is super convenient, less configuration
    , better integration. Less configuration, less error prone.

???+ Question
    # Why not read the docs?
    Same reason as above. Git pages is convenient than read the docs, it requires no
    further configuration, except access token. As to read the docs, you need to
    write v2 config file, plus several settings on web pages.

???+ Question
    # Why mkdocs instead of sphinx?
    reStructured Text and Sphinx is way to tedious, though powerful. With extension,
    you'll find almost all features are available in mkdocs, in a neat and productive
    way. Poetry and Markdown, are the two key factors driven me develop this template.

    # How to trigger a release build?

    Once you've tagged either of (main, master) branch with `v`(for example, v1.0), then github actions will trigger a release build and finally publish documentation to https://{your_github_account}.github.io/{your_repo_slug} and push a wheels to pypi.

    You can also manually trigger this one:
    ```
    git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release v1.0"
    git push --tags
    ```
    then check on github to see if actions is executing. Once it's done successfully.

???+ Question
    # How to manually publish documentation?
    By default, every push to github will trigger a documentation dev build, with the name is ${poetry version --short}-dev. And every tag starts with 'v' on main/master branch will cause a release build, and documentation will be built too.

    However, by any chances, you can manually build and publish your documentation with:

    ```
    poetry run mike deploy -p `poetry version --short`
    poetry run mike set-default -p `poetry version --short`
    ```
    The above commands simply build documentation locally and push to github, then github will publish it.
